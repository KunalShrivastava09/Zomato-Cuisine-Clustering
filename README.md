# Zomato-Cuisine-Clustering
This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning to segment Zomato restaurants based on their key attributes, such as rating, votes, cost, and cuisine type. The goal is to identify distinct restaurant clusters and build a simple recommendation engine that suggests similar or highly-rated restaurants within the same cluster.
